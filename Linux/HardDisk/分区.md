How to align partitions for best performance using parted

There are two common problems when creating partitions in Linux on big storage arrays. The first is easy, and the warning message from *fdisk* is a bit of a giveaway:

```shell 
WARNING: The size of this disk is 8.0 TB (7970004230144 bytes).
DOS partition table format can not be used on drives for volumes
larger than (2199023255040 bytes) for 512-byte sectors. Use parted(1) and GUID 
partition table format (GPT).
```

The answer: **use *parted***. Don’t have it? Install it!

The second problem is this warning from *parted*:

```
(parted) mklabel gpt
(parted) mkpart primary 0 100%
Warning: The resulting partition is not properly aligned for best performance.
Ignore/Cancel?
```

…and no matter what combination of numbers you use, the message just keeps coming back. It’s tempting to ignore it, but don’t.

There are [a](http://blog.derakkilgo.com/2010/06/12/warning-the-resulting-partition-is-not-properly-aligned-for-best-performance/) [few](http://askubuntu.com/questions/201164/proper-alignment-of-partitions-on-an-advanced-format-hdd-using-parted) [posts](http://superuser.com/questions/349887/gnu-parted-how-to-deal-with-the-error-about-proper-aligment-of-partitions) on the subject, but [this one from HP](http://h20564.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c03479326&DocLang=en&docLocale=en_US&jumpid=reg_r11944_uken_c-001_title_r0001) really gets to the guts of the problem.

Here’s a quick step-by-step guide to aligning partitions properly. It’s just an abstraction of the HP post, but hopefully easier to follow. This will work for most arrays (in fact it works for all the arrays that I’ve seen); there are more options in HP’s post, but I’ve included the most common configuration here.

1. Get the alignment parameters for your array (remember to replace  sdb    with the name of your device as seen by the kernel).

   ```shell 
   # cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/optimal_io_size
   1048576
   # cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/minimum_io_size
   262144
   # cat /sys/block/sdb/alignment_offset
   0
   # cat /sys/block/sdb/queue/physical_block_size
   512
   ```

2. Add *optimal_io_size* to *alignment_offset* and divide the result by *physical_block_size*. In my case this was (1048576 + 0) / 512 = **2048**.

3. This number is the sector at which the partition should start. Your new

    

   parted

    

   command should look like

   ```
   mkpart primary 2048s 100%
   ```

   The trailing ‘s’ is important: it tells *parted* that you’re talking about sectors, not bytes or megabytes.

4. If all went well, the partition will have been created with no warnings. You can check the alignment thusly (replacing ‘1’ with the partition number if necessary):

   ```
   (parted) align-check optimal 1                                            
   1 aligned
   ```

As I alluded to before, there are cases where this won’t work: if *optimal_io_size* is zero, for example, [there are other rules to follow](http://h20564.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c03479326&DocLang=en&docLocale=en_US&jumpid=reg_r11944_uken_c-001_title_r0001). Of course it would be nice if *parted* could do thisâ€”the values are all available as ioctls, after allâ€”but then what would I write about? 



### 格式化硬盘

```shell 
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sda
```



```shell 
parted /dev/sda   (用part命令对3T硬盘进行分区处理）
mklabel gpt       (用gpt格式可以将3TB弄在一个分区里)
unit TB           (设置单位为TB)
mkpart primary 0 3 (设置为一个主分区,大小为3TB，开始是0，结束是3）
print              (显示设置的分区大小）
quit               (退出parted程序)
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1  (用parted将分区做好后，进行格式化操作,完成后即可挂载使用)
```
